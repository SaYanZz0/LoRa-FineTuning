# LoRA Fine-Tuning Project

This project demonstrates the use of **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)** for fine-tuning pre-trained models efficiently. 
LoRA is a parameter-efficient transfer learning technique that significantly reduces the computational resources and time required for training large-scale models.
