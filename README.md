# LoRA Fine-Tuning Project

This project demonstrates the use of **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)** for fine-tuning pre-trained models efficiently. 
LoRA is a parameter-efficient transfer learning technique that significantly reduces the computational resources and time required for training large-scale models.

## Project Overview

The notebook includes:
- An introduction to LoRA and its advantages in model fine-tuning.
- Setup instructions for installing required dependencies.
- Detailed code for implementing and training models using LoRA.
- Visualizations and metrics to evaluate the performance of the fine-tuned models.

## Features

- **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning:** Focused on reducing trainable parameters while achieving high performance.
- **Visualization Tools:** Performance metrics and visualizations included for deeper insights.
- **Scalable Workflow:** Designed to work with various models and datasets.
